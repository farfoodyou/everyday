hhkb make me more easy to touch the correct key on keyboard.
I need know what will happen what if I do sometings.

Time order or theme order ?

So you need summary every week.

I install Linux again. 
It is so quick that 

终于又可以输入中文了

今天整理

还装了ddd
刚开始因为没有字体
屡屡报错
最后看了文档知道缺失了什么字体
自己手动加上之后就可以显示了
然后意识到需要用sudo ddd才行
不然会导致死机,只能进入tty2 kill掉了

现在好像直接ddd也行了

plot 好像不能work,真是悲伤
gnuplot -bg 'grey96' -font '-*-helvetica-bold-r-*-*-*-120-*-*-*-*-iso8859-*' -name 'dddplot1' -geometry +5000+5000 [1864]: Exit 1

Using `Edit ⇒ Preferences ⇒ Helpers ⇒ Plot Window', you can choose whether to use the Gnuplot plot window (`External') or to use the plot window supplied by DDD (`builtin'). This is tied to the following resource:

和 资源的类型有关
Resource: plotTermType (class PlotTermType)
The Gnuplot terminal type. Can have one of two values:

If this is `x11', DDD "swallows" the external Gnuplot output window into its own user interface. Some window managers, notably mwm, have trouble with swallowing techniques.
Setting this resource to `xlib' (default) makes DDD provide a builtin plot window instead. In this mode, plots work well with any window manager, but are less customizable (Gnuplot resources are not understood).

就是说x11不能使用builtin吧
试了下成功了,可以看到一维数组了
我再试下二维数组
